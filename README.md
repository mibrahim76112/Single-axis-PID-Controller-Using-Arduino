# One-axis-PID-Controller-Using-Arduino

For my end-semester project, we designed a PID drone controller with a gyro sensor that provided real-time feedback to the Arduino. It automatically adjusted motor speeds to balance the drone when a force or disturbance was applied. This project allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and gain valuable hands-on experience in control systems and programming.
